# School Projects
In this repositiry I keep my projects from school. Theese projects are made in C# using Xamarin and WPF.

## Snake
It is a simple mobile snake game that I made in school. The objective is to control the snake to eat apples. Swipe gestures are used to control the snake's direction. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the screen.
### How to play:
  - Swipe to control the snake.
  - Eat apples to grow.
  - Avoid hitting the screen edges.

## Minesweeper (saperWPF)
A remake of the popular game "Minesweeper," where the player needs to mark every bomb on the map. Numbers indicate the count of bombs in adjacent cells. The game ends when all bombs are marked correctly or when a bomb is detonated.
### How to play:
  - Left-click to reveal a cell.
  - Right-click to mark a potential bomb.
  - Use numbers to deduce bomb locations.

## To do list
An app designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks. Users can add notes for tasks, mark them as finished, or delete them.
### How to use:
  - Add new tasks with details.
  - Mark tasks as finished.
  - Delete tasks.
